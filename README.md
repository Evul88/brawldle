# Brawdle

Brawdle is a fun web application inspired by the popular word guessing game Wordle, but with a unique twist: it's based on the video game Brawlhalla! In Brawdle, players can enjoy two exciting game modes, both in regular and daily versions.

## Game Modes

### 1. Normal Game
In the normal game mode, players have to guess a random character from Brawlhalla. Each attempt provides hints to get closer to the correct answer.

### 2. Who's This Character
In this mode, a character is displayed in black, showing only its silhouette. Players must guess the character based solely on its shape.

## Daily Game Modes

In addition to the regular game modes, Brawdle offers daily versions of both modes:

### 1. Daily Normal Game
Each day, players have the chance to guess the character of the day, which will be a different random character every day.

### 2. Daily Who's This Character
Similar to the normal mode, but with a daily silhouette character that players must guess.

## How to Play

1. **Select the Game Mode:** Choose between the Normal Game or Who's This Character.
2. **Make Your Guesses:** Enter your guesses and receive feedback to get closer to the correct answer.
3. **Enjoy the Daily Challenges:** Come back every day to face a new challenge in the daily modes.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** Easy to use, designed for all Brawlhalla fans.
- **Two Game Modes:** Guaranteed fun with the normal mode and the challenging Who's This Character mode.
- **Daily Modes:** Fresh challenges every day to keep the excitement going.
